# About this project

This project is a web version of the popular board game qwirkle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwirkle

## Current Progress

The app is working locally and has the rules completely implemented but online multiplayer has not yet been properly implemented

### Running the app

Clone this git repo onto your local machine and run the `npm start` command from the root directory.
The only working gamemode currently is the 'play game locally with 4 players' options so click that from the
main menu
